## About 
After finishing [this](https://github.com/adrianabm/weather-app) I decided to give another try on making a weather app UI on my own. It is still being improved :)


## This project is using:
* React.js
* Redux
* react-promise
* react-axios
* OpenWeatherMap API 
* SASS

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and enter the project directory
2. Install all dependencies

  ```
  npm instal
  ```
  
2. Run the application - it should be available on http://localhost:8080
  ```
  npm start
  ```
